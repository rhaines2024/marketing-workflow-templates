# Marketing Workflow Templates ✨

## Project Overview
Marketing Workflow Templates is a web application designed to streamline marketing tasks using pre-built templates. The application allows users to search for workflows based on various filters, making it easier to find the right template for their specific needs.

## Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
   ```bash
   cd marketing-workflow-templates
   ```
3. **Open `index.html` in your web browser to view the application.**

## Usage
- **Finding Templates:**
   - Use the search bar to find specific apps, roles, or use cases.
   - You can filter templates by tags such as Reporting, Optimization, SEO, Google Analytics, etc.
- **Viewing Template Details:**
   - Click on any template card in the workflow grid to view more details about that workflow.

## Features
- Search functionality to quickly find desired templates.
- Filtering options by different marketing categories (e.g., Reporting, Optimization, SEO).
- Responsive design that adjusts to various screen sizes.
- Loading states for improved user experience during data fetch operations.
- Error handling for data loading issues.

## Dependencies
Currently, the project does not include any dependencies in a `package.json` file, as it is a simple HTML/CSS/JavaScript application without external libraries or frameworks. If you decide to add functionality in the future that requires external libraries, consider using a `package.json` for better dependency management.
